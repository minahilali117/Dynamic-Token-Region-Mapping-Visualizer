# Dynamic Token-Region Mapping Visualizer

This project provides a visual interpretation of how different words in a multilingual prompt influence the image generated by a Stable Diffusion model. It captures attention maps from the cross-attention layers and produces a token-to-region heatmap overlay.

## Overview

The visualizer enables:

- Extraction of cross-attention weights from a Stable Diffusion model
- Visualization of which words affected which regions in the generated image
- Support for multilingual prompts (e.g., English, Japanese, Spanish)
- Saving or displaying the attention heatmap alongside the generated image

## Requirements

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install torch diffusers transformers matplotlib seaborn opencv-python
